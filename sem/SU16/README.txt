This is an independent study course I did with Prof.S.Kurtek at OSU, it covered some interesting models and some classical results in the analysis of directional and shape data like landmark methods and manifold frameworks. I learned a lot of literature as well as applications in the field. Part of the course is modeling a classification task suggested by Prof.A.Dena.
