This discussion is mainly about topological data analysis as well as the conformal prediction with Prof.MacEachern and Prof.Peruggia. In this series of discussions, we talked about the development of methodologies in TDA and a close-up TDA analysis with mainly Vietoris-Rips/witness complex. We also planned to discuss the conformal prediction methodologies and transductions.

I implemented the analysis by 'FRAME' for data generated from point processes with an estimated censored percentile.

During thanks-giving, I implemented the analysis by 'FRAME' suggested by Prof.MacEachern and this turns out to be pretty easy to understand and produce a very useful functionality for 2-dimensional data.
