This is an independent study course/seminar I did with Prof.S.MacEachern at OSU, it turned out to be very productive and I finally managed to organize the materials we discussed as well as recent developments like variants of Bayes nonparametric models (Dirichlet and its extensions/Gaussian models) into the monograph A Course in Bayesian Nonparametrics. It turned out to be a very beneficial course and a journey that I benefited a lot from. Later I grew my interest in Bayes nonparametrics and this is the seed.
