This seminar was planned to be part of Prof.Peruggia's independent study course. However, due to time constraint, I only prepared the materials yet not able to bring it to discussion. The set of notes contains the basic properties of stochastic processes and two major viewpoints of treating it as random functions or dynamic system. The first viewpoint ends up with stochastic geometry and works of Dr.Adler; the second viewpoint ends up with the proof of Bernoulli conjecture and related techniques.
