This is the "Five lectures in robust statistics" I conducted myself at OSU, it first reviewed classical results and framework in robust statistics like Huber's M-estimator and relevant results from Banach space theory and convex analysis. I had a plan to extend the material I collected in this course into a full-length course material.
