I found, in 2019, in a book store, that the above book is extremely helpful in building intuition in high dimensional statistics.

This is a workshop I carried out with my friends during my first semester at OSU, it basically discussed some results and techniques used frequently in high dimensional statistics. At that time my focus was obviously the mathematical nature of the subject and it did arouse my interest, I think my interest in high dimensional inference and modeling are partly from here.
